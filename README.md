# LichessBot
Bot created for lichess.com using open source stockfish chess engine

This is a fork of https://github.com/inushahapuarachch/LichessBot

Using Javascript you can utilise the open source chess engine stockfish https://github.com/nmrugg/stockfish.js/blob/master/stockfishjs alongside websockets to have a fully automated bot that does not even need to be viewable on your screen (no mouse clicks etc) in around 40 lines of code.

3. Go to lichess.org
4. Play any game
5. Enjoy!

# Different Versions
